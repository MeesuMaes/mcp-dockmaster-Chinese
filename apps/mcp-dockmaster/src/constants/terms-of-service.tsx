## Acceptance of Terms
By installing or using MCP-Dockmaster (the "App"), you ("User") agree to these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you disagree with any part of these Terms, you must not install or use the App.

## Licensing
MCP-Dockmaster is provided under the MIT License. You may freely use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies under the MIT License terms. The MIT License explicitly disclaims warranties, and the App is provided "AS IS," without any express or implied guarantees.

## Anonymous Analytics (Opt-In)

Upon first use, you will be asked to opt-in to anonymous analytics.

Data collected (if consented) may include OS version, App version/configuration, basic usage statistics, and anonymized error logs.

This data helps us improve the App. No personal information (e.g., IP addresses, usernames) is collected or stored.

## Analytics Provider (PostHog)

MCP-Dockmaster uses PostHog for analytics if you consent.

Data is securely transmitted and retained for approximately 12–13 months.

You can disable analytics collection anytime via App settings.

To request deletion of collected analytics data, contact us as detailed in Section 9.

## User Feedback (Formspree Integration)

Feedback submission via Formspree is optional.

If personal contact information is voluntarily provided, we may use it to respond to your inquiries.

Do not submit sensitive personal information in feedback.

Feedback data is used exclusively to improve the App and is subject to Formspree's privacy policies.

## Privacy and Data Retention

- Anonymous analytics data retained for 12–13 months; older data deleted or anonymized.
- Feedback stored indefinitely unless deletion is requested (see Section 9).
- We never sell or trade your data. Data shared with third parties (PostHog, Formspree) is strictly for service improvement.

## User Responsibilities

You must use the App lawfully, without infringing the rights of others or disrupting App operations.

Do not submit illegal, harmful, or offensive content via feedback. We reserve the right to delete inappropriate submissions.

## Disclaimer of Warranties

MCP-Dockmaster is provided "AS IS" without any warranties, explicit or implied, including merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement.

Our total liability is limited to the amount paid by you for the App, if any.

## Arbitration Clause and Governing Law

These Terms are governed by the laws of the British Virgin Islands (BVI), excluding conflict-of-law rules.

Any disputes arising from these Terms or use of the App must be resolved by binding arbitration conducted in English by the American Arbitration Association (AAA), held in New York City, New York.

Arbitration will occur individually, without class actions or consolidated claims. You may opt-out of arbitration by notifying us within 30 days of accepting these Terms.

Parties may seek temporary or preliminary injunctions in courts with appropriate jurisdiction pending arbitration outcomes.
